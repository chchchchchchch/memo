  Digital culture.
  Operating on surfaces provided by multinational corporations.
  Condemned to stay there (=outside?). Strict Borders. Non-Porous.
  (Disneyfication. Exile on Main Street)
  
  Social media as in socialising. (Not as in social?)
  
  (The Digital as something overly complicated. Tired of the digital?)
  
  It IS complicated. Question the 'what' and 'why' and then the 'how'.
  And here we go. The space to ask this is hard to find on the surface.
  (<- the much bigger problem)

  For me to make something was never detached from technology.
  Not a pure idea breeding in my mind that just needs to be
  materialised when finished. I enjoy the resistance of technology
  just as a pen and a brush are different in resistance.

  Talking of 'printmaking' and not of 'graphic design' is to set the focus
  on the technological aspect of producing visual work. 'Printmaking' has a
  long history and (enormous richness) of innovative use and appropriation of
  technology. a creative relation with tools more complicated and interesting
  than operating on the surface of a cloud-based service.

  ----

  So it's 'printmaking' not in the sense of ... ?
  but in the relation of technology and form.

  HAPPY HACKING!

 ====

  Technology is set aside as something inferior being disqualified as
  'just a tool'. This seems (a bit) absurd in a world where a lot of our
  experiences are mediated by technology. While it seems reasonable not
  to fall for technical gimmicks it seems wrong to ignore technology in
  favour of a consumer service.
  
   
                                    ?
  Not art, not design but the technological creation of visual form.
  Not a, maybe necessary, IF
  but a, maybe not so simple, HOW
  (Forg[eo]t the WHY)

  Maybe it's not about printmaking
  in the (traditional)/anachronistic sense of a ink trapped workshop
  but in the creative relation of form and technology.
  
  Anyway. This is not the answer to a problem but the first step on journey

  (Borders) Separations become porous. Hacks may become part of a setup,
  as well as amateur and professional (things) (may) intertwingle.
  Buggy may or may not be replaced,
  temporary parts stabilize while stable parts dissapear. 
  A unique offering of an environment where ink never dries and nothing is
  ever finished. (The artificial)Established borders between this and that
  may be traversed. (as you like.)

  Academic, hobbyist and software from the military/industrial complex merge.
  Sounds much more interesting than DesignDesign software.

   are going to be erased.)
